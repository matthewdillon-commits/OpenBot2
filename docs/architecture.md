# Architecture

OpenBot combines a React app, a Hono API server, PostgreSQL, CopilotKit Intelligence, AG-UI Bot endpoints, and governed browser computers.

  <img src="../assets/architecture-light.svg" alt="A turn goes from the app to the server, which sends it to a Bot over AG-UI. Every tool call the Bot makes returns through the gateway, which resolves the target, decides it against the configured policy, records an audit row, and only then acts, or refuses and names the rule. Allowed actions reach that Bot's own computer, one container each holding its own Chromium, logins and workspace, created by the supervisor. Every decision lands in PostgreSQL; threads and memory live in CopilotKit Intelligence.">

`scripts/start.sh` starts PostgreSQL, `agent-computer`, `agent-bot`, `agent-langgraph`, and the supervisor through Docker Compose, then starts `server` and `app` on the host.

The compose file also defines optional SPIRE services. `start.sh` does not start them.

## Runtime flow

1. The app opens a channel or direct Bot session.
2. The server resolves the signed-in actor and selected coworker.
3. CopilotKit runtime sends the turn to the configured AG-UI endpoint.
4. The surface registers available frontend tools: browser tools, MCP tools, and components granted to that Bot.
5. Acting browser/file/MCP calls return to the server for authorization and audit.
6. The server streams results back to the app and Intelligence thread.

## Browser action governance

The computer itself does not decide policy. The server gateway is the action boundary:

1. resolve the target from the server-held snapshot or request subject;
2. evaluate the current action policy;
3. write an audit row for the decision;
4. call the computer only when the decision forwards;
5. write a second audit row if a forwarded action fails.

Policy rules can inspect:

- `tool.name`
- `intent`
- `bot.id`
- `actor.id`
- `page.url`, `page.host`
- `element.ref`, `element.role`, `element.name`, `element.type`
- `key`
- `file.path`, `file.name`, `file.extension`
- `mcp.server`, `mcp.tool`, `mcp.effect`
- `channel.id`, `recipient.id` (agent messaging and sub-agents)

Rules use CEL expressions plus case-insensitive `contains()` and `matches()`.
Deny rules are evaluated before allow rules. The policy engine fails closed: a
missing or empty policy permits nothing, a broken deny rule denies, and a broken
allow rule does not permit. OpenBot's shipped startup default is explicit:
`deny: []` and `allow: ["true"]`, unless `AGENT_COMPUTER_POLICY` or a saved
administrator policy replaces it. A malformed configured policy stops server
startup.

## Computers

`agent-computer` requires `COMPUTER_TOKEN` and permits only `/health` without it. Docker Compose binds it to `127.0.0.1:4100`.

With `COMPUTER_SUPERVISOR_URL`, each Bot gets its own computer container, workspace volume, and browser profile. Without it, all Bots share `AGENT_COMPUTER_URL`.

A command on the computer inherits PATH, locale and terminal names, and the proxy variables, not the rest of the process environment. Userinfo is stripped from a proxy URL. `COMPUTER_SHELL_ENV` names anything else a deployment wants passed.

The supervisor exposes only ensure, stop, reset, and list operations. It holds the Docker socket, so do not expose it outside the deployment network. Set `COMPUTER_RUNTIME=runsc` to run computers under gVisor on hosts that support it.

## Human control and secrets

Handovers are audited as control events:

- `computer.help_requested`
- `computer.control_taken`
- `computer.control_released`

While a person controls the browser, Bot actions are refused rather than queued.

Secret entry is separate from chat content. The audit trail records that a secret was requested or supplied and the character count, not the secret value.

## Watching a Bot work

Two surfaces beside the conversation. The screen is the live browser, proxied over a websocket and gated on the same question as every other route about that Bot. The Activity tab is what the Bot did away from the browser: every command with its output and exit code, every file read, write and listing, newest first.

Activity is held in the browser for the open conversation and is gone on reload. It is a window rather than a record; the record is the audit trail, which is server-side, survives restarts, and is what an investigation reads. A saved file contributes its path and size and never its contents, matching the write route, which declines to echo them because a Bot may be saving something it was told in confidence.

## Coworkers and channels

A coworker is a durable Bot profile:

- `agents` stores runtime identity and endpoint/key reference.
- `agent_profiles` stores name, title, role, owner, visibility, and deletion state.
- `agent_preferences` stores per-user roster state.

A channel is a conversation with one or more coworkers and a CopilotKit Intelligence thread mapping. Starting a new channel creates a new thread. A Bot may message another Bot or post to a room it belongs to; that send is a governed action (`channel.message_sent` / `channel.message_refused`) and wakes the recipient asynchronously. A real wake reply is stored and wakes the other members; empty acknowledgements are not. Posted Bot messages are stored in `channel_messages` and merged into the transcript by time. The wake itself is in-process: a second server replica will not run a job this one accepted; the message is still stored and visible.

A Bot may also start a sub-agent for a finite chunk of work (`spawn_subagent`). That is a run of the same coworker, not a new profile: the call returns an id immediately, the child runs in the background, and it reports to the parent — the parent is woken the same way a `message_agent` recipient is. A follow-up names that id so the work stays on the same worker. Spawn and the report go through the gateway (`subagent.started` / `subagent.refused` / `subagent.reported`). The child has no composer; a person sees that it ran on the audit trail. The task channel that holds the brief is hidden from the roster. The child is offered this deployment's server-side tools (MCP, knowledge, web search) and not messaging or another spawn. Browser tools stay on the conversation surface.

Who may reach one is decided by membership: every channel route resolves the caller in
`channel_memberships` and refuses without a row. `channels.allowed_groups` is declared in the
tenant package and stored, and is not part of that decision — `users.groups` is never populated by
any sign-in path, so a group-based rule has nothing to evaluate. Treat it as a declaration waiting
on group membership from the identity provider, not as a control that is running.

See [coworkers.md](coworkers.md).

## Components

Components are frontend tools a Bot can call instead of answering only in prose.

Sources:

- compiled React components in `app/src/components/gallery/`;
- sandboxed components authored and published from `/admin/playground`.

Governance:

- compiled components are published when first seen by the app catalogue sync;
- sandboxed components are saved as drafts and become usable only after publish;
- every call asks the server whether the component exists, is published, and is not withheld from the Bot;
- component data functions require a separate per-component grant.

The shipped component data functions read the audit trail: `botActivity` and `recentRefusals`.

## MCP and skills

MCP servers and skills share the plugin grant table, but they have different ownership rules.

- MCP tools are admin-governed because they can reach external systems with stored credentials.
- Skills are reusable instructions. A person can create personal skills and attach them only to Bots they own. Administrators create deployment skills.

The curated MCP catalogue contains Atlassian, Box, Slack, Salesforce, and ServiceNow. Custom MCP servers must pass URL checks; unknown tools and custom-server tools are treated as writes unless positively classified as reads.

Every MCP call checks the grant first, then evaluates the same action policy engine with MCP context, then audits the result.

## Tenant package and knowledge

`TENANT_PACKAGE_DIR` points at the tenant package. The default is `../examples/fintech`.

Required package files:

- `brand.yaml`
- `agents.yaml`
- `channels.yaml`
- `model.yaml`
- `knowledge.yaml`

The server validates the package at startup. Channel agent IDs must match declared agents. Knowledge sources currently support Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive declarations.

Connector credentials are stored through the credential vault and referenced by id, not stored inline in YAML.

## Security boundaries

- Server routes enforce auth and roles; admin pages are backed by server-side administrator checks.
- Sign-in is Google, Microsoft or Okta from the environment, plus SAML and OpenID Connect providers registered at runtime and routed by email domain. One resolver answers both questions a run asks about a person, whose threads these are and which Bots they may run, so the two can never disagree.
- `INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAILS` is a floor: an address it names is made an administrator at every sign-in and cannot be demoted from the People screen. Everybody else's role is decided there, and every change writes an audit row.
- Registering, changing or removing an identity provider is administrator-only. Better Auth's SSO plugin guards those routes with a session alone, which would let any signed-in person register a provider for a domain.
- A registered identity provider belongs to the deployment, not to whoever registered it. Better Auth scopes its own listing and removal to the registering user and cascades the row from that user, so two administrators saw two different deployments and deleting the one who set sign-in up would have deleted the company's sign-in. Reads and removals go through OpenBot's own administrator-only routes against the whole table.
- A provider's client secret and SAML signing material are encrypted at rest with `KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, through a wrapper on the Better Auth storage adapter, since the plugin stores them as plaintext JSON. OAuth access and refresh tokens use Better Auth's own encryption, keyed on `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`.
- Signing in, being refused, and being granted the administrator role by configuration each write an audit row. Without them nothing recorded that somebody who could edit `INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAILS` had promoted themselves, and revoking a person deleted the sessions that were the only evidence they had been here.
- Removing somebody deletes their sessions and denies their address, because deleting the user row alone is not removal: the next sign-in through the provider recreates it.
- With no identity provider configured, the deployment refuses to start unless `OPENBOT_SINGLE_USER=true` says every request may be one fixed administrator. That flag is the only thing that permits it; `NODE_ENV` does not.
- `KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY` must be a base64-encoded 32-byte value. The example key is refused with `NODE_ENV=production`.
- Credential plaintext is encrypted at rest, never returned by APIs, and redacted from audit events.
- Browser navigation allows `http` and `https`; cloud metadata addresses are refused under every configuration.
- `AGENT_COMPUTER_ALLOW_PRIVATE_HOSTS=true` is for local development only.
- Computer tokens and supervisor tokens must be long random values outside local development.
