 * its computer belong to the computer, not to one implementation: the tools are registered by the
 * surface and are on offer to every Bot alike, so a Bot told nothing about them is a Bot that
 * apologises for work it could have done. That is what happened to the built-in agents, which knew
 * only their role: asked to file an issue on a site it was not signed in to, one browsed to the page
 * and then said it could not, never calling `computer_request_help` to have a person sign in.
