# Changelog

What changed, for somebody deciding whether to upgrade. Written for the person running LimitlessAI, not
for the person who wrote the commit: a line belongs here when a deployment behaves differently
afterwards, and does not when only the code moved.

Newest first. `Unreleased` is what is on `main` and not yet tagged.

## Unreleased

### Features

- **Cron, webhook, and inbound email enqueue the same unattended job.** A durable `job_triggers` row (org-scoped) names the actor, goal/channel, Intelligence thread, coworker, and standing prompt. When a cron is due, a signed webhook POST arrives, or a message hits a mapped mailbox, the API inserts a `jobs` row through `enqueueUnattendedJob` — the same insert Send-and-go uses. The worker still claims with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` and calls `startUnattendedRun`. No cookie Request: the actor is the person stored on the standing row. A missing mapping or thread is a refuse; the trigger does not mint a thread. Cron, webhook, and email jobs may use server-side computer tools and pause as `needs_you`. Persist is `CopilotRuntime.runner.run` on the existing mapped thread — true only when `getThread` / `getThreadMessages` include the user prompt and the assistant result. There is no second runner and no in-process Map.
- **Computer tools execute on the server.** Click, type, snapshot, files, and the shell go through `ComputerGateway` in the API tool loop and through `/api/agent-tools/call` for a remote AG-UI coworker. The channel tab only renders the watch pane and Activity lines. An unattended job can use these tools after the tab closes. Login, 2FA, and a secret ask on the computer, persist `jobs.needs_you`, notify the channel, and return immediately — closing the tab does not cancel the ask. One shared Chromium is allowed for the first organization; a second org is refused until `COMPUTER_SUPERVISOR_URL` selects the docker provider (one computer per org×bot). Gallery and sandboxed components still run in the browser.
- **Send-and-go continues a channel after the tab closes.** The composer’s Send-and-go control queues a `jobs` row. The worker claims it with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` and runs the same built-in or remote AG-UI coworker, with CRM, web search, knowledge, granted MCP, and computer tools when the gateway is configured and the browser is on. The existing Intelligence thread is required — a missing mapping or thread is a refuse. The worker starts the coworker through `CopilotRuntime.runner.run` (the same Intelligence runner a tab turn uses) on that mapped thread. Persist is true only when `getThread` / `getThreadMessages` on that thread include the user prompt and the assistant result. Persist false is not success. The job row is not a second transcript (prompt + skinny resultText / outcome only). The roster `lastMessage` updates when the job finishes. A finished job also stores a skinny goal outcome on the row (Active | Needs you | Done, last_action, last_action_at, who ran, CRM record ids if a write already returned them) — not an approval card. In this tree the goal is the existing channel plus its Intelligence thread. Cron, webhook, and inbound email enqueue this same row.

### Docs

- **Part B: cron, webhook, and inbound email enqueue the Phase 1 job.** Citations: `server/src/jobs/enqueue.ts`, `server/src/jobs/triggers.ts`, `server/src/jobs/inbound.ts`. Persist is `CopilotRuntime.runner.run`. Part C stays honest: there is no Goals home and no Phase 5 approval cards.
- **Part B: computer tools are server-side.** Execute lives in `server/src/computer/computer-tools.ts`. The watch tab is render-only. HITL is `needs_you`. A second organization is refused on a shared Chromium until `COMPUTER_SUPERVISOR_URL`.
- **UX contract: home is goals + one brain.** First screen is Composer to LimitlessAI, then Goals (name, status, last action, time) — not chats, not agents. Owner talks only to LimitlessAI. “See the work” (operator / admin) opens that goal’s A2A room; Cmd-K “Rooms” is for power users. Phase 1 skinny goal is status + last action (Active | Needs you | Done). Phase 5 adds measure/improve on the same object. Do not put Sales / Website / Marketing / Customer / Ops in the owner nav. Do not merge PR #11. A deployment behaves no differently.
- **Roadmap and Part A: one orchestrator, specialists on demand.** The customer-facing default is LimitlessAI — a goal, not a five-bot sidebar. Phase 4 is one manager plus skills/playbooks, sub-agents, and A2A rooms (two doors: customer talks to LimitlessAI; operator can open the room). Phase 5 stays the full measure loop; Phases 1 and 2 record a simple outcome when a job finishes and the result is known. Do not merge PR #11. A deployment behaves no differently.
- **[docs/product.md](docs/product.md) is the LimitlessAI contract.** Part A is the GTM: not a bot builder; one intelligence layer above specialized agents; OBSERVE → UNDERSTAND → PRIORITIZE → ACT → MEASURE → IMPROVE; governed self-improving (see, test, approve, learn); swappable models; CopilotKit is the conversation layer, not the product. Part B is what a deployment does today (turns start in the open app, from Send-and-go, or from cron / webhook / inbound email; computer tools execute on the server; persist is `CopilotRuntime.runner.run` on the existing Intelligence thread; orgs are query-scoped, not RLS). Part C is what is not built: self-serve SaaS, the Goals home and self-improving loop.
- **[docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) is the phase plan.** Unattended runs, then computer-on-the-server, then cron/webhook/inbound email, then one manager + specialists on demand (reimplement; do not merge PR #11), then measure/improve, then SaaS. Code for those phases is other pull requests.
- **The README describes that product**, not the CopilotKit OpenBot alpha laptop clone. How-to-run, surfaces, and configuration are unchanged and still accurate. Sign-in copy uses the same tagline. CopilotKit is how a turn runs.
- **Release images publish to this repository.** `ghcr.io/matthewdillon-commits/openbot2`, not `ghcr.io/copilotkit/openbot`.

### Chat

- **The working line stays until the Bot starts writing.** Sending used to show a thinking line that vanished the moment a tool appeared, so a web search or CRM call left a blank transcript with only a Stop button and a tiny function name. The line now says Working (with motion) for the whole wait, the composer repeats it next to Stop, and built-in tools such as web search are named as actions rather than raw identifiers.
- **CRM tools are named as actions.** `crm_create` reads Add to CRM, not "Crm create", and the person's name sits beside it. After a write, the tool result lists title, company, location, and email so the Bot can confirm the save in a sentence instead of echoing only the name.
- **The thinking line appears as soon as a message is sent.** It used to wait until the runtime marked the run as started, so the first send sat still for a second or more with no sign the Bot had heard. The person's message is posted first — including the first message of a new channel, which used to wait for the thread to join before showing thinking. Thinking follows immediately.
- **Web search no longer dies on a one-character query.** Tavily refuses anything shorter than two characters, and CopilotKit Intelligence was turning a failed tool schema into a red "Unprocessable Entity". The tool now answers with a sentence the Bot can act on, tool schemas sent to the model are stripped of JSON Schema draft metadata some providers reject, and a 422 on the turn is explained in a sentence rather than a status phrase.
- **A tool loop now finishes on OpenAI-compatible hosts.** CopilotKit's `openai/<id>` string uses the Responses API, which emits `item_reference` on the second step. Hosts such as xAI reject that as Unprocessable Entity after the search has already run, so the answer never arrives. When `OPENAI_BASE_URL` is set, built-in Bots use Chat Completions instead. Real OpenAI, with no base URL, still uses Responses.
- **A tenant chat no longer 500s its computer or 404s home.** Package agent ids are already org-scoped; prefixing them again overflowed the computer's 64-character id limit and failed every control poll. The limit is 128, already-scoped ids are left alone, and the home page no longer polls grants for the `"default"` placeholder. A brand-new channel also skips restoring a thread Intelligence has not created yet.

- **A coworker can take more than eight tool steps.** A follow-up that reads two people, finds two websites, and updates four CRM rows used to stop after the eighth call with no closing sentence. The loop now allows twenty steps so a Bot sent off to do a job can finish both people and say what it did.

### CRM

- **A person create can name the employer.** Passing `company_name` finds or creates that company and links it in the same write, so a research add does not leave Company blank. The People list shows job title and location under the name.
- **A person create does not duplicate.** The same email, or the same name at the same company, updates the existing row — a research add that calls create twice with two titles keeps one person.

### Multi-tenant organizations

A deployment can now hold more than one customer. People still sign in once; work is scoped to an organization. Existing data is backfilled into the `local` organization. Sales-led hosting sets `PLATFORM_SUPERADMINS` so someone can create an organization and invite its owner. `OPENBOT_EMAIL_AUTH=true` turns on email and password without an OAuth client; create-account asks for an organization name, and a signed-in person can also create a workspace they own. Stripe, seat quotas, per-org SSO, and Postgres RLS are not in this release.

### Upgrading

Two configurations now refuse to start:

- A provider configured with no `INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAILS`. Set it to at least one address.
- No provider at all and no `OPENBOT_SINGLE_USER=true`. Configure a provider, set
  `OPENBOT_EMAIL_AUTH=true`, or set `OPENBOT_SINGLE_USER=true` to say you meant a deployment where
  every visitor is one administrator. This no longer depends on `NODE_ENV`, which is unset by
  default and so let exactly the dangerous case through. A deployment already running open needs the
  line added before it will start again.

Registering an OpenID Connect provider needs every host in its discovery document in
`TRUSTED_ORIGINS`, not only the issuer. Better Auth 1.7 checks each endpoint it finds, so a Google
issuer also needs `oauth2.googleapis.com` and `openidconnect.googleapis.com`. Registration is
refused with the untrusted host named.

A Bot id may now contain only letters, digits, hyphen and underscore, and must start with a letter or
digit. The same rule container and volume names have always followed. A deployment whose
`COMPUTER_BOT_ID` breaks it refuses to start and says so, rather than answering 400 to everything.

`AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS` is new and unset, which keeps the audit trail forever, as before. Set it to a
whole number of days to have old rows removed.

`MANAGED_AGENT_AG_UI_URL` is no longer required to start. The one-container image does not carry a
Bot, so requiring it registered the shipped Risk Analyst against a host that was not there and every
conversation with it failed. Leave it unset for that image. A laptop `scripts/start.sh` still points
it at `agent-langgraph`. A URL with no `MANAGED_AGENT_TOKEN` still refuses to start; a leftover
token with no URL is ignored.

A `.env` copied from an older `.env.example` still has `MANAGED_AGENT_AG_UI_URL=http://localhost:4201/ag-ui`.
Unset it before `docker run --env-file .env`, or the coworker comes back.
The built-in Bot refuses to start without `OPENAI_API_KEY`. It used to start, report healthy, and
then fail every conversation, so a missing key looked like a working deployment. The LangGraph Bot
already refused the same way.

Sessions survive and nobody signs in again.

### Added

- **CRM sits above Skills.** People, companies, opportunities, campaigns, and conversations — LimitlessAI-2's five-module book, scoped to the organization. People have the outreach pipeline (`new` → `researched` → `contacted` → `replied` → `interested` → `booked` → `won`, plus lost / nurture / DNC). Opportunities sit on a five-column deal board (qualify, proposal, negotiation, won, lost). Conversations are one row per person from the latest email, SMS, or call — not the notes table. SMTP and Twilio deliver when configured; otherwise a send is recorded as logged. A DNC person cannot be emailed. Bots get `crm_search`, `crm_get`, `crm_create`, `crm_update`, and `crm_send`, judged as `intent == "crm"`. Tracking tokens stay off the list.
- **Plugins sit between CRM and Skills.** `COMPOSIO_API_KEY` loads Composio's toolkit catalogue (Gmail, Slack, GitHub, and the rest) and lets a person connect one through Composio's hosted auth. `GMAIL_AUTH_CONFIG_ID` pins Gmail to an auth config already created in Composio, so connect does not mint a second one — except on localhost, where that pin would send Google OAuth back to production. Filter pills are All, Featured, Installed, and the eight most populated categories; search finds the rest. The connection is scoped to the organisation, not a shared Composio user.
- **The product name is LimitlessAI.** Sign-in, the sidebar, the browser title, settings, and credentials copy all take it from the tenant package `product_name`.
- **The sign-in screen is os.limitlessai.ca/login.** Split form and aerial hero, Inter Tight, labelled fields, black Sign In, Continue with Google, and Continue with Apple marked Soon. Google lights up when `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` are set — or LimitlessAI-2's `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` names — and the same address links to an existing email/password user. Sign-in and create-account share a measured height so the column grows instead of jumping; Motion respects `prefers-reduced-motion`; errors are tied to the fields; buttons press in; type is antialiased and balanced.
- **Email and password sign-in, without an OAuth client.** `OPENBOT_EMAIL_AUTH=true` with the usual Better Auth session values shows Sign in / Create account. Create-account asks for an organization name so the first workspace is visible before anybody is inside the app. A signed-in person can also create another organization from `/o`.
- **A phone can open the sidebar.** The rail becomes a sheet under 768px; a bar at the top of the app, Admin, and Settings opens it. The composer no longer assumes a desktop width, and a channel's detail pane is a full-screen overlay on a phone instead of shrinking the transcript.
- **A channel can hold a room of up to eight coworkers.** New channel's To: field takes several people, in the order they will appear, and the first is the lead. One shared thread; one speaker per message you send. `@` a member to have them answer that turn — a name that is not already in the room stays in the words and does not invite them yet. Replies are labelled with who spoke, and Watch / settings follow the current speaker. Home still starts a 1:1.
- **An administrator can switch browser use off**, under Admin → Boundaries, so Bots are not offered the computer tools and do not try to open pages. The switch is not a CEL rule and is not dry-runnable: the chat surface skips the tools, built-in Bots are not told they have a computer, and the gateway refuses every computer action. MCP tools are not this — a deployment that has turned the browser off can still let a Bot talk to Jira. A deployment that has never said otherwise stays on.
- **Bots can search the public web.** A deployment with `TAVILY_API_KEY` offers every Bot a `search_web` tool: titles, links and short passages, so a fact can be cited without opening a browser. The call is judged by the same policy MCP is (`tool.name == "search_web"` or `intent == "read_tool"`) and written on the trail as `web.searched` / `web.search_refused` — the query and the addresses, never the passages. Absent key, the tool is not offered. A framework Bot that calls it back through `/api/agent-tools/call` now reaches first-party tools as well as MCP, which also lets `search_company_knowledge` run on a remote Bot.
- **A Bot can answer from a connected source, as the person asking.** The connectors have been
  writing `documents`, `chunks` and `document_acls` and nothing ever read them back, so a deployment
  that connected a source got rows in PostgreSQL and still no citation. A Bot now has a
  `search_company_knowledge` tool, and it returns only the documents the person asking is allowed to
  read — filtered in the database against that person's own principals rather than fetched and
  filtered in the server, so a document they may not read is never handed over. A deny beats an
  allow, and a document with no ACL rows is readable by nobody rather than by everybody. Each result
  carries the document's title, the link that opens it, and the passage that matched. A search that
  finds nothing says so, rather than returning an empty string a model would fill in from memory.
  Every search is on the audit trail as `knowledge.searched`, naming the query and the documents
  returned and never quoting their text. The tool is only offered when there is something to search.
  Matching is PostgreSQL's own full-text search over the stored passages: nothing in the deployment
  produces embeddings yet, so the vector column is left alone and ranking by meaning follows the
  first connector that writes one.
- **Releases are cut by a workflow, not by hand.** `Create release PR` bumps the version and promotes
  `## Unreleased` to a numbered section; merging the pull request it opens is what publishes. Merging
  builds and pushes one image to `ghcr.io/matthewdillon-commits/openbot2`, signs a build provenance attestation
  for its digest, tags the commit and creates the GitHub Release with `container-images.json` so a
  deployment can name an exact digest rather than a tag somebody could move. See
  [docs/releasing.md](docs/releasing.md).
- **CI now runs the thing it ships.** Two checks were added. `migrations` refuses a schema change
  with no migration written for it, and a snapshot that has drifted from the schema. `image` builds
  the container, boots it with embedded PostgreSQL, and fails if it does not answer or if a
  supervised service is respawning. A single `verify` check covers every job, so branch protection
  needs one entry. The same checks run again against the release commit when a release is published,
  so they gate the release rather than the proposal for one.
- **Sign in with Google, Microsoft or Okta.** Any one of them turns sign-in on; configure several
  and the sign-in screen offers each, on matching buttons carrying each provider's own mark.
  `INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAILS` says who is an administrator. It is required whenever a provider is
  configured, because nothing else grants the role, and it is now a floor rather than a one-off:
  an address it names is made an administrator at every sign-in, so adding somebody to the list
  works even after they have already signed in.
- **SAML and OpenID Connect, registered while running.** `/admin/identity-providers` takes the
  metadata a company's identity team supplies and registers their own IdP. Somebody then types their
  email address on the sign-in screen and the domain decides which provider they are sent to, so a
  company mid-merger can run two. Registering, changing or removing one is administrator-only, which
  the upstream plugin does not require: it guards those routes with a session, and anybody who could
  reach them could register a provider for a domain and mint themselves colleagues.
- **A People screen.** `/admin/people` lists everybody who has signed in, with the provider they came
  through and when they were last here, and lets an administrator promote, demote, or remove
  somebody. Removing ends the session they are using and stops the next sign-in, keyed on the
  address so signing in again through the provider does not quietly create a new account. Every
  change is on the audit trail. Somebody named in `INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAILS` cannot be demoted or
  removed here, and nobody can do either to themselves.
- **One container that runs the whole thing.** The root `Dockerfile` builds an image carrying the
  app, the API, a Bot computer, and optionally PostgreSQL, supervised together. Point `DATABASE_URL`
  at a database you already run and the built-in one never starts; leave it unset and the container
  is self-contained. See [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) for the measured minimum sizes and
  the platforms it has been run on.
- **Bots can run commands.** `computer_run_command` runs a command in the Bot's `/workspace`, so a
  Bot can install a tool, unpack what it downloaded, or run what it was asked to run instead of only
  driving a browser. Governed like every other action: the policy decides, the audit row is written
  first, and a rule can refuse a shell outright with `intent == "run_command"` or refuse particular
  commands. The command is recorded; its output is not.
- **The audit trail shows the command.** A command row names what ran, the way a file row names the
  path, rather than reporting an element it was never about.
- **`COMPUTER_SANDBOX=on`** turns on Chromium's own sandbox where the host permits user namespaces.
  Which way it went is printed at start-up either way.
- **New chat.** The direct Bot chat has a button that starts a fresh conversation, which it had no way
  to do before: the thread was minted once and remembered for that Bot forever, so the only way out
  of a conversation was to clear the browser's storage by hand.
- **You can watch what a Bot is doing, not only what it is looking at.** The screen answered half the
  question: a Bot spending two minutes in a terminal showed a blank browser and one grey line per
  command, with the output nowhere. A command line in the transcript now opens to show what it
  printed, its exit code, and whether it was cut short or stopped. Beside the screen there is an
  Activity tab carrying every command, file read, file write and listing as they happen, newest
  first, with a count on the tab so a Bot working away from the browser is visible without switching
  to it. A saved file shows its path and size, never its contents. This is a live view of the open
  conversation; the record is still the audit trail.
- **Sign-in is on the audit trail.** Rows for signing in, for being refused, and for the configured
  administrator list granting somebody the role. Two questions had no answer before: who granted
  themselves administrator by editing `INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAILS`, and whether somebody just removed had
  ever been here, since removing them deletes the sessions that were the only evidence. A trail that
  is unavailable never blocks a sign-in.

### Fixed
- **The one-container image registered a coworker it could not run.** `MANAGED_AGENT_AG_UI_URL`
  defaulted to `localhost:4201` and was required, so Risk Analyst appeared on the roster and every
  conversation with it failed. The URL is optional; the package omits that coworker when it is
  unset. `scripts/start.sh` still points it at `agent-langgraph` on a laptop.
- **A boundary rule applied on one server out of N.** The policy is read from memory on every action,
  which is right, but memory was only ever filled at boot. An administrator's new deny rule was
  enforced by whichever process served the request and roughly one action in N went through it, while
  the admin screen reported success because the row really was saved and the audit trail agreed
  because it records the boundary each process started with. Both honest, and both describing
  something other than what the fleet was enforcing. A write now announces on Postgres in the same
  transaction and every server re-reads, including on reconnect, so a server that was down when the
  rule changed catches up rather than waiting for a restart. Reset travels the same way.
- **A ref resolved on one replica and nowhere else.** The gateway turns the opaque ref in a click into
  the element it points at, and that mapping lived in a `Map` in the process that took the snapshot.
  On any other replica the ref resolved to nothing, so a deny rule written about the element did not
  match and the click went through, recorded as allowed with no rule. It is in Postgres now, keyed on
  the generation the computer stamped, so a ref from a superseded page still resolves to nothing.
- **Anybody signed in could act as anybody's Bot.** The Bot id travels in the path and the acting
  routes checked only that somebody was signed in, so a signed-in person could drive another person's
  private Bot, reset its browser, read its screen and fire its granted tools. Every route under a Bot
  id now asks the store the same question the roster already asks, and a Bot that does not exist and
  one belonging to somebody else answer identically.
- **The computer fleet listing was open to any signed-in person.** It ignores its `:botId` and returns
  every Bot's machine, so it told anybody who could reach it every Bot id in the deployment and
  whether each was running, private coworkers included. Administrator-only now.
- **A Bot id could name a directory outside the profiles volume.** The id arrives as a URL segment or
  a header, was joined onto a filesystem path, and `reset` deletes that path recursively as root, so
  `../../tmp/something` deleted it. Refused at the request boundary and again where the path is built.
- **A mistyped deny rule permitted instead of refusing.** A rule that parsed and evaluated but
  answered with something other than true or false was neither a match nor an error, so
  `deny: ["Submit order"]` — what somebody writes who reads the list as labels — let the action
  through with nothing logged, while the rule sat on the Boundaries page looking as though it were in
  force. Any non-boolean answer is now a broken rule and takes the existing fail-closed path.
- **Rotating a Bot's key left the old one live.** Editing a key wrote a new vault row and repointed
  the Bot at it, leaving the previous credential decryptable and still valid with nothing listing it,
  so rotation did not do the one thing rotation is for. Deleting a Bot left its key live too. Both
  revoke now.
- **Nothing recorded what changed about a Bot.** Ten mutating routes wrote one audit row between them
  and there was no event type for any of the other nine. A Bot's endpoint is where conversation
  content is sent, so "who pointed this Bot at that host, and when" is the first question in an
  incident and could not be answered. Eight event types and eight rows now, recording what changed and
  never a value.
- **The people list and the channel list grew without bound.** Both were read in full on every render,
  and reading one person ran the whole people aggregate over the deployment twice per role change.
  Both are paged now, and the people screen searches on the server so somebody can be found without
  walking pages.
- **A computer accumulated one browser per Bot, forever.** `COMPUTER_MAX_BROWSERS` and
  `COMPUTER_BROWSER_IDLE_MS` set the two limits. Nothing closed an idle one, so a deployment
  where every employee has a Bot trends toward a resident Chromium per employee in one container until
  it is killed for memory. There is a cap and an idle timeout, and closing one costs only a relaunch
  because the profile is on disk.
- **The audit screen's filters were sequential scans.** It filters by event type, by who did it and by
  what it was done to, and the only index was on the timestamp, over what becomes the largest table in
  the deployment. Each filter leads its own index now.
- **A deployment with no identity provider came up open by default.** Covered under Changed above,
  and listed here too because it is the one on this list that was reachable from the internet.
- **Registering a company's identity provider was owned by whoever registered it.** Better Auth
  answers its own listing route with only the providers the person asking registered, and refuses a
  removal from anybody else, so a second administrator opened the Identity providers screen, found
  it empty, and registered one that already existed. Worse, the row cascaded from that person's user
  row: deleting the administrator who set sign-in up deleted the company's sign-in with them. What is
  registered is a fact about the deployment, so reads and removals go through OpenBot's own
  administrator-only routes against the whole table, and a provider outlives the person who added it.
- **A customer's client secret was in the clear.** The SSO plugin writes `oidc_config` and
  `saml_config` as plaintext JSON, with the OAuth client secret for that company's directory inside
  them: the one secret here not going through `KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY`. Both are now encrypted at rest.
  Rows written before this still read, and are re-encrypted the next time they are written. OAuth
  access and refresh tokens use Better Auth's own encryption, keyed on `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`.
- **A failed provider registration looked like a button that did not work.** The error was rendered
  on the page behind the dialog, which was covering it.
- **Deleting a component in the playground could release one the build ships.** `DELETE
  /api/sandboxed/:name` deleted from the shared components table by name, without checking
  which kind of component the name belonged to. Naming a compiled component removed its
  governance row, and the foreign keys took that component's per-Bot withholdings and its
  function grants with it. Withholding is the half that fails open: a published component is
  available to every Bot unless a row says otherwise, so the next catalogue announcement brought
  the component back published, and available to a Bot it had deliberately been kept from. The
  audit row called it `kind: "sandboxed"`. The endpoint now refuses a name this surface does not
  own and answers 404, the way publishing already did. A governance row whose source is already
  gone is still this surface's to clear.
- **A write could follow a symlink out of the Bot's workspace.** The confinement resolved the
  directory a write would land in but not the name it would land on, so a link left at `notes.txt`
  pointing outside was followed by the write; a read through the identical link was already refused.
  The gateway had already decided and written the audit row against the path as it was asked for, so a
  rule written for `credentials/` never saw the file that was written and the trail named a file
  nothing had touched. A dangling link escaped the same way, because resolving the path throws where
  the write would still land. Links pointing back inside the workspace continue to work.
- **A Bot could become root inside its container.** `sudo` was granted as `NOPASSWD: ALL`, and the
  comment above it named the two conditions that made that acceptable: the container being one Bot's
  alone, and not holding a database. The image meets neither, because the supervisor is deliberately
  not in it and `EMBEDDED_POSTGRES=on` is a documented way to run it. So root read another Bot's
  workspace, the API's environment, and the audit database recording what it did. The grant now names
  the package managers, so `apt-get install` still works and `sudo cat /proc/1/environ` does not. It
  is a floor rather than a boundary: code a model wrote needs a computer per Bot with
  `COMPUTER_SUPERVISOR_URL` and a sandbox under it with `COMPUTER_RUNTIME=runsc`, both of which this
  already supports and neither of which the single-container image can reach.
- **A command could take the computer down, or outlive being stopped.** Output was accumulated in
  full and only trimmed at the end, so `cat` of a large file allocated until the process that owns
  the browser died; it is now bounded as it arrives, and still reports that it was truncated rather
  than quietly ending. A stop signalled bash alone, so `sleep 30 | cat` left its children holding the
  pipes and the call never returned; the whole process group is signalled now. A `timeoutMs` of zero
  or less killed the command before it started and called it a timeout; it has a floor as well as a
  ceiling.
- **Stop did not reach a running command.** The `/exec` route never took the person's abort, so the
  plumbing for it was dead code and a stopped run left the command finishing inside the container.
- **The live-screen socket did not check the address it was given.** Every acting path resolved
  through the gateway, which refuses a foreign or cloud-metadata address; this one asked the provider
  directly and then put `COMPUTER_TOKEN` in the query string of whatever it was told.
- **`COMPUTER_SHELL_ENV` refuses the names that run before a command.** Naming `GITHUB_TOKEN` is an
  operator deciding a Bot may use a token. Naming `BASH_ENV`, `ENV`, `LD_PRELOAD` or the shell option
  variables is handing a Bot a hook into every later command, which is unlikely to be what was meant,
  so those are refused and said out loud rather than passed. A name that is not a variable name is
  now reported too, instead of quietly disappearing.
- **A deny rule naming one field refused every action that did not have it.** `deny:
  contains(command, "rm -rf")`, the example the documentation gives, refused every click, keypress,
  navigation and file read in the deployment. Two correct behaviours combined into a wrong one: the
  policy context left out fields an action did not have, cel-js treats a missing field as an unknown
  identifier and throws, and a thrown deny counts as a match so that a mistyped deny refuses rather
  than quietly permitting. Every field is now bound, with a neutral value where the action has
  nothing to put there, so a rule about a shell answers honestly about a click instead of refusing
  it. Rules about the action they are for are unchanged. The audit row still omits what did not
  happen.
- **A command longer than 45 seconds reported failure while it carried on running.** The transport
  gave every call the same deadline, which was shorter than the shell's own 120 second default and
  600 second maximum, so `apt-get install` told the person the computer had not responded and then
  finished installing inside the container. A command now gets a deadline that outlasts the shell,
  which reports a timeout itself and says so.

- **A Bot's shell no longer inherits the deployment's environment.** Commands ran with the computer
  process's own environment, so `env` in the one-container image printed `KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and
  the rest of `.env`. The shell now receives PATH, locale and terminal names, and the proxy
  variables. Userinfo is stripped from a proxy URL, so a password in `HTTP_PROXY` is not in `env`.
  Anything else is named in `COMPUTER_SHELL_ENV`.
- **A deployment served over plain HTTP could not start a conversation.** The chat surface minted
  identifiers with `crypto.randomUUID`, which browsers withhold outside a secure context. On a
  laptop `http://localhost` counts as one, so this never showed up in development; on a real
  address it does not, and the surface did nothing at all when you pressed send. No message, no
  error. Ids now come from an API with no such restriction.
- **A Bot asked to be signed in, in words, and nothing happened.** Handing over the browser is a tool
  call, and a sentence in the transcript is not one: "please sign in and let me know" leaves the
  person with no wheel to take and the page where it was. Bots wrote that sentence anyway, and one
  went further and asked for a username and password to be typed into a sign-in page nobody could
  reach. The guidance now says that calling `computer_request_help` is what asking means, names the
  sentences that are not it, and says the person cannot see the page at all until control is handed
  over. Asked to file an issue on a site it was not signed in to, a Bot now offers the wheel on the
  first attempt instead of the third.
- **A package Bot did not know it had a computer.** The instructions that make the computer usable —
  snapshot before acting, and ask a person to take the wheel at a sign-in rather than reporting the
  task as impossible — were imported by the two shipped Bots and by nothing else, so a built-in agent
  knew only the role its package gave it. The tools were on offer to it the whole time. Asked to file
  an issue on a site it was not signed in to, it browsed to the page, said it could not, and never
  called `computer_request_help`, so nobody was ever offered the wheel. Built-in agents are now told
  the same thing the shipped Bots are told, wherever a computer is configured.
- **A chat could quietly forget everything and carry on.** The browser remembers a thread id for each
  Bot, and nothing ever asked whether Intelligence still had that thread. Where it did not, the
  transcript loaded empty, every later message silently recreated an empty thread under the same id,
  and the Bot answered as though the conversation were new — with the reason nowhere but the server
  log, as a 404 flattened into a 500 by the time it reached the browser. A remembered thread is now
  checked before it is used: one the platform provably does not have is replaced, because there is no
  conversation left to lose, and a check that fails for any other reason keeps the thread and says on
  screen that earlier messages could not be loaded. A person reading a confident answer can now tell
  whether the Bot has read what came before it.
- **The first browser action a Bot was ever asked for failed.** Creating a computer and starting it
  are two calls to Docker, and a name the daemon has not published yet answers the second with a 404.
  The supervisor treats that as a lost race and rebuilds, which is right, but it went straight back
  round: the retry landed a millisecond later, saw the same unpublished name, and spent the only
  other attempt on it. The whole request then failed as Docker being unreachable, the person was told
  the computer could not be started, and the next message worked. It waits one poll interval before
  rebuilding now, which is what the health wait already uses for the same question.
- **A framework Bot asked for a browser action and nothing happened.** `agent-langgraph` ends a run
  when the model calls a tool the surface owns, which is how a tool that lives in the browser is
  supposed to work: the run finishes, the surface acts, and the next run carries the result. But the
  call was only reported to the surface from the node that executes this deployment's own tools, and
  that node is exactly what an ending run skips. The person saw their own message, no answer under
  it, and no explanation, because a run that finishes carrying nothing is not an error. Every Bot
  action in the browser was affected: opening a page, filling a form, asking for help at a sign-in.

### Changed

- **A retention policy for the audit trail.** `AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS` removes rows older than the
  window it names, swept hourly by whichever server holds an advisory lock. Unset by default, because
  deleting somebody's audit trail because a default said so is the worse of the two failures. The
  trail stays append-only: the database permits a delete only when the transaction declares a
  retention window and only for rows already outside it, so removing recent rows is still impossible
  and an `UPDATE` still is under every condition.
- **`allowed_groups` is documented as a declaration, not a control.** The tenant package writes it and
  nothing reads it on any access path, and `users.groups` is written by nothing either, so both halves
  of the rule are waiting on group membership arriving from the identity provider. Channel access is
  membership alone. The columns stay, because they are the right shape for the rule they are named
  for. Thanks to [@NathanTarbert](https://github.com/CopilotKit/OpenBot/pull/92) and
  [@andreolf](https://github.com/CopilotKit/OpenBot/issues/82).
- **Running with no sign-in takes a flag and nothing else.** It used to be locked with
  `NODE_ENV=production`, which is exactly backwards: `NODE_ENV` is unset unless somebody sets it, so
  a container on a VM with a hand-written env file and no identity provider served every visitor on
  the internet as an administrator, silently, because nothing looked wrong from the outside. A
  deployment with no provider now refuses to start unless `OPENBOT_SINGLE_USER=true` says it was
  meant. `.env.example` ships that line switched on, so a clone still runs with no configuration at
  all, and the line is greppable in a way a default never was. `OPENBOT_DEV_NO_AUTH` is still
  honoured.
- **Requires Better Auth 1.7**, which adds an `issuer` to every account. Migrations `0002` and `0003`
  add the column and backfill existing rows with their provider's real issuer, so nobody is asked to
  sign in again. The column stays nullable on purpose: a rolling deploy runs migrations and then
  serves from old and new replicas at once, and an old replica writes an account without it, so
  making it required in the same release would break the first sign-in of everybody who landed on a
  replica that had not been replaced yet. The constraint belongs to a later release.
- **Where a Bot's computer runs is now a plug.** One `ComputerProvider` interface sits under the
  gateway, with the Docker supervisor as one implementation and a shared computer as another. A
  computer somewhere else is an adapter rather than a change to the governed path. Thanks to
  [@mu-hashmi](https://github.com/CopilotKit/OpenBot/pull/57) for the refactor.
- The address a provider hands back is checked before anything is sent to it, and the cloud metadata
  addresses are refused whatever a provider says.
- The container image runs as an unprivileged user rather than root.
