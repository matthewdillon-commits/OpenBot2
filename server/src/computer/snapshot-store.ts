/**
 * Where the gateway keeps the snapshot it resolves refs against.
 *
 * A ref an acting call carries is opaque, and the gateway turns it into the element it points at by
 * looking it up in the snapshot this server took. That lookup is the whole security model: a rule
 * that says "never click Submit" is only worth anything if the server, not the caller, decides what
 * a ref is. See the header of gateway.ts.
 *
 * It cannot be a `Map` in the process. OpenBot is several server processes behind a load balancer,
 * and the process that answered the snapshot is rarely the one that answers the click that uses its
 * refs. Held in memory, the mapping is missing on every other replica: the ref resolves to nothing,
 * the policy decides with no element in front of it, and the audit row cannot say what was acted on.
 * The boundary silently stops applying, which is the failure the pull request template is written to
 * catch and the one #21 flagged this cache as still having.
 *
 * So it goes through Postgres, like channel activity and the policy before it. The table holds one
 * live snapshot per computer, replaced whenever a newer one is taken.
 *
 * Staleness, the reason a persisted snapshot cache is rightly regarded with suspicion, is answered by
 * the generation the far-side computer stamps on every snapshot: `resolve` only accepts a ref whose
 * generation matches the stored one, so a ref from a superseded page resolves to nothing rather than
 * to whatever now holds that ref. The refs cannot "resolve to names that are no longer on screen"
 * because a ref from an old screen no longer matches. The computer itself makes the same generation
 * check when the action reaches it; this keeps the policy decision and the audit row honest in the
 * meantime, on whichever replica the action lands.
 *
 * Without a database it stays in memory. Tests that only exercise decision logic do not need
 * Postgres, exactly as the policy store does not.
