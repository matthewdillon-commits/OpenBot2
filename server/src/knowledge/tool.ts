/**
 * The company's own documents, as something a Bot can call.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A TOOL rather than retrieval stapled to the prompt. A Bot that is handed passages before
 * it speaks is answering from whatever the retriever guessed the question was. A Bot that calls this
 * asks its own question, and the call is a thing the trail can record, the model can be refused, and
 * a person can read back. It reaches the model the same way an MCP tool does — through
 * `builtInAgentConfiguration`'s `tools`, executed on the server, never registered by a browser.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES IT SAFE IS THE QUERY, not this file. Every row is filtered against the asker's own
 * principals in SQL before it leaves PostgreSQL (see search.ts). So this tool cannot return a
 * document the person asking could not have opened themselves, whichever Bot is holding it. That is
 * the reason it is offered without a per-Bot grant of its own: the grant would refine who may ask,
 * and the ACL already decides what any answer may contain.
 *
 * SAYING NOTHING IS AN ANSWER. An empty result returns a sentence saying so rather than an empty
 * string, because a model handed nothing fills the gap from training and cites a document that does
 * not exist. The Knowledge coworker's own prompt already tells it to say when nothing is connected;
 * this is the same instruction arriving as data.
