/**
 * Answering from the company's documents, with only the ones the asker may read.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `connectors/sync-persistence.ts` writes `documents`, `chunks` and `document_acls`
 * and nothing has ever read them back. The Knowledge coworker answers as though something were
 * behind it, so a deployment that connects a source gets rows in Postgres and no citation.
 *
 * THE ACL IS THE POINT, and it is evaluated in SQL rather than in this process. A read path that
 * fetches rows and filters them here has already fetched them: the wrong document is in memory, it is
 * one refactor from being returned, and the query cost scales with the corpus rather than with the
 * answer. The predicate below is the boundary, so the database never hands over a row the asker may
 * not read.
 *
 * DENY WINS, AND SILENCE DENIES. A document is readable when some ACL row allows one of the asker's
 * principals and no ACL row denies one. A document with no ACL rows at all is readable by nobody,
 * which is the same shape the rest of this repo uses for a grant: absence is the refusal, so a
 * document whose ACLs failed to sync is invisible rather than public.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO is rank by meaning. `chunks.embedding` is `vector(1536)` and nothing in this
 * repository has ever written one: `connectors/contract.ts` has the adapter supply embeddings and no
 * adapter exists yet, and there is no embedding model in the tenant package or the environment. So
 * matching here is PostgreSQL's own full-text search over `chunks.content`, which needs no
 * configuration that a deployment does not already have. When an adapter starts writing embeddings,
 * the ranking changes behind this signature and the ACL predicate does not move.

/**
 * Who is asking, as principals rather than as a user row.
 *
 * `groups` is accepted and matched, and is empty in every deployment today: `users.groups` is written
 * by nothing (see #82 and #92, which established that both halves of the group control are missing).
 * Matching it anyway means a `group:` ACL starts working the day groups arrive from an identity
 * provider instead of needing to be found and changed. Until then such a row matches nobody, which
 * denies rather than permits.
