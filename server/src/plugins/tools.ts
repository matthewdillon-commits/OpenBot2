 * The tools a Bot may call, as the runtime's own tool definitions, executed on the server.
 *
 * The loop used to run in the browser: every MCP tool was registered with `useFrontendTool` and its
 * handler posted back to `/api/plugins/call`. That made a browser a hard requirement for a Bot to do
 * anything, which rules out an embedded widget, a run nobody is watching, and any surface that is
 * not our own app.
 *
 * Nothing about governance moves with it. `callTool` is still the only path to a vendor: it checks
 * the grant, evaluates the policy, writes the audit row, and only then calls out. This module hands
 * the model a description of what it may call; the store remains what decides whether a call happens.
 *
 * Read at run time rather than captured, so a grant an administrator adds or revokes applies to the
 * next run rather than after a restart.
 */
/**
 * What a refused call answers with.
 *
 * The transcript draws a refusal differently from a result, and it has only the tool's answer to go
 * on. Guessing from the wording would break the first time an administrator rephrased a policy
 * message, so the answer says which it is. The model reads this too, and "Refused." in front of a
 * reason is what it should be told anyway.
 *
 * The constant lives in `./refusal` so HTTP tests can import it without pulling the MCP SDK
 * (and its CJS EventSource) into the module graph.
